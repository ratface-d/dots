ok i will be occasionally adding things here. for now i wanna keep it simple. for example, i just learned that if i 
wanted to update my personal linux docs i can just [[id:589ef265-09f0-43e7-949b-15e98a1060a4][linux notes]] and update that instead of updating this one. which
i'm sure is useful and now i just keep writing after updating that. which i enjoy


just adding a quick link to [[id:847e62f9-e617-41d3-81c3-3994c4d719f4][python]]
